Create the game of battleship (a modified version) using Express.

Features:
1. User connects to the server, provides a user name.
2. User can view a list of players available.
3. Can invite a waiting player.
4. The invited player accepts or declines invitation.
5. If the invited player declines invitation, both players go back to step 2.
6. If a waiting player accepts invitation then they're asked to initialize game.
7. To initialize a game, the user places five battleships on a 10x10 grid. The battleship a user places is only visible to the user who places it.
8. Once both the users place their battleships, they can start the play.
9. A random player (among the two) is asked to start first, they take turns to play.
10. A player can hit a cell by clicking on it. If the opponent has a battleship at that cell, it is struck (sinks) and the striking user is shown that there was a strike at that cell. If the striking player has a battleship at the same cell, it is not affected by this step. If the cell had no battleship of the opponent, no action is taken.
11. The first player to sink all of the opponent's ship is declared a winner.
12. Once the game is over (won or lost), the user will have to reconnect and provide their name again.
