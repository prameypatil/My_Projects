Assignment 2: Due 11:59PM March 13th

The openweathermap.org site provides weather data. We can access, for example,
the weather in Houston, by sending a request to

http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Houston,us&units=imperial

Write a program that will read from a file a list of cities. It will then
get the temperature and the current condition (for example, sunny or cloudy)
from the webservice mentioned above. The program will then display, in sorted order of 
the city name, the current temperature and the weather condition. 
It will also report the hottest city and the coldest city.

Grading:
Total [100]: 78

Program runs [20]:
All tests pass [20]:
Test quality [10]:

Code coverage [10]: -10
When build is run, the generated coverage report does not show any coverage at all.

Code quality [20]: -2
Remove commented out dead code. Found this bad practice in multiple files.

Design quality [20]: -10

WeatherReport: 
No need for two fields here.
Increased coupling.

WeatherServiceUI:
Too much code, need to use better constructs than do - while.

WeatherServiceAPI: Hard coded URL in the wrong place.

OpenWeatherMapInteract:
println in arbitrary code, this code is now not usable anywhere
except in a console - fails OCP, high coupling, low cohesion, not
extensible.

This is disconnected from the interface that we built - need to
implement that interface so WeatherReport can depend only on the
interface. Lack of understanding of how these things are suppose
to relate as the design evolves.
